# CoreMVC_3
MVC Core 3.0 Template. Initial save. 
This is simply a project made from following the videos at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6n9fhu94yhVkdrusLaQsfERmL_Jh4XmU.
It has an excellent description of the Request Pipeling and the files structure of a complicated MVC application. 
It currently goes as far as form handling using model binding.
